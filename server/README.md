# Pipmon Server

The pipmon server is a C# [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core) application that was setup using the command line tooling. To set up something similar, take a look at the web template by running `dotnet new web` in the directory you want to start a project in.

## Setup

1. Install the latest [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
2. In the ./pipmon/server directory run `dotnet run`.
